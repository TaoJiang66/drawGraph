# Description of this project
This project aims to visualize network relationship. The reason why I create this project is that there are plenty of usual works are focusing on dealing with relationship between knowledge nodes, while experts provide the relationship of knowledge points (point A is prior of point B, etc) is contained in knowledge map files, which is saved as .csv file. 

It is inconvient to analyze the network from that kind of file, so I decide to implement a tool to visual the relation.

First, we need to transform relationship into graph; then visualize that.
